In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component nested deeply within several route components.  The problem is that if a parent route component doesn't match, the nested route might not render correctly, leading to unexpected behavior, especially if `useParams` is used for accessing dynamic segments within the URL. This can cause a `useParams` hook to return an empty object even when the URL appears to contain the needed parameters. This often happens when the route matching logic is flawed or overly complex, causing the nested route to not receive the proper context from its parent routes.
